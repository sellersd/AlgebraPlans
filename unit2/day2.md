# Sets

As discussed previously, sets are a collection of objects. Lets consider some useful sets.

## Counting

Imagine you and a friend are walking through the woods and you find a truffle. After you make this miraculous discovery then you would say you had 1 truffle and as you searched for more, you would have 2 truffles, 3 truffles, etc. However, before you made this initial discovery you were not walking around thinking that you had 0 truffles. This is the **natural** way to think about counting and leads us to the set of natural numbers $$\mathbb{N} = {1,2,3,4,...}.$$

But, now that you have some truffles, you have no choice but to eat them. After devouring your find, you now have 0 truffles and some people would say we need a new set of numbers for this possibility and others would say we do not. Because we are a precocious bunch of students, we will consider this set the set of whole numbers $$\mathbb{W}={0,1,2,3,4,...}.$$

Now that all of the truffles are gone, you return to your village and brag about how delicious the truffles were. Chef Preston asks if your group of truffle searchers could provide her with 10 truffles for her new chocolate truffle recipe. You agree, but since you have 0 truffles, you now somehow have less than 0 truffles, or you could say you have -10 truffles. Leading us to the set of **integers** which includes the natural numbers, their opposites, and zero. $$\mathbb{Z}={...,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,...}$$

You and your friend find 11 truffles, 10 for Chef Preston and 1 extra. What is there to do with this extra truffle except eat it? If you have 1 truffle and 2 people to eat it then neither person receives an entire truffle, but all we have at this point are numbers in the set of integers, $x \in \mathbb{Z}.$ This does not allow for the case where we have 1 item split into 2 pieces, perhaps some sort of ratio, $\frac{1}{2}.$ These types of numbers are the **rational** numbers $$\mathbb{Q} = {...,-4, -\frac{7}{2} -3, -\frac{2}{3}, 0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{10}{5}, \frac{127}{3}, ...}$$
These numbers are any numbers that can be represented as a ratio and therefore include the integers. As decimals, these numbers can all be represented as terminating or repeating decimals.

After eating half a truffle and walking back to town you discover a perfectly circular truffle. You measure the circumference and diameter and divide these two numbers, and while this number is close to $\frac{22}{7},  you notice this does not give you a rational number, it is an **irrational** number. The result is a non-repeating, non-terminating decimal. This set of numbers is notated as $\mathbb{R}-\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R} \\ \mathbb{Q}.$ Which means the set of **real** numbers less the set of rational numbers. So what are the real numbers?

You can think of the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ as all numbers that can be represented as a ratio or that cannot be represented as a ratio. That is the union of the sets of rational and irrational numbers. These are the numbers we are usually working with in algebra. However, don't despair our journey through the set of numbers is not over yet.
