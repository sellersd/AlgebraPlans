# Sets and Polynomials

## Learning Targets

4. Interpret **linear, quadratic,** and exponential expressions in terms of a context by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity.
5. Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of
   the quantity represented by the expression.

- a. Factor quadratic expressions with leading coefficients of one, and use the factored form
  to reveal the zeros of the function it defines.
- b. Use the vertex form of a quadratic expression to reveal the maximum or minimum value
  and the axis of symmetry of the function it defines; complete the square to find the vertex
  form of quadratics with a leading coefficient of one.
- c. Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions.

- Example: Identify percent rate of change in functions such as $y = (1.02)^{t}$, $y = (0.97)^{t}$, $y = (1.01)^{12t}$, $y = (1.2)^{t/10}$, and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.
