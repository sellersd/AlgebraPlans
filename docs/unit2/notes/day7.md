# Factoring Polynomials

## GCF

Consider $9x^2+3x$. This polynomial consists of 2 monomials, lets examine it in pieces to build a conceptual model.

| Constants | Prime Factorization |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| $9$       | $3^{2}$             |
| $3$       | $3^{1}$             |

| Variables | Prime Factorization |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| $x^{2}$   | $x^{2}$             |
| $x$       | $x^{1}$             |

Based on our previous experience, we know the GCF of the constants is $3^{1}$ and analogously for $x$, $x^{1}.$

Find the GCF for $60x^{12}+15x^{9} +9x^{6} + 3x^{3}.$

## Factoring by Grouping

One tool that can be useful for factoring is factoring by grouping. In this technique instead of trying to find the GCF of all terms in an expression we group certain terms together and find the GCF in those groups.
