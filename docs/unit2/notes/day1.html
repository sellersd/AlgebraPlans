<h1 id="sets">Sets</h1>
<p>As discussed previously, sets are a collection of objects. Lets
consider some useful sets.</p>
<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
<p>Imagine you and a friend are walking through the woods and you find a
truffle. After you make this miraculous discovery then you would say you
had 1 truffle and as you searched for more, you would have 2 truffles, 3
truffles, etc. However, before you made this initial discovery you were
not walking around thinking that you had 0 truffles. This is the
<strong>natural</strong> way to think about counting and leads us to the
set of natural numbers <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{N} =
{1,2,3,4,...}.\]</span></p>
<p>But, now that you have some truffles, you have no choice but to eat
them. After devouring your find, you now have 0 truffles and some people
would say we need a new set of numbers for this possibility and others
would say we do not. Because we are a precocious bunch of students, we
will consider this set the set of whole numbers <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb{W}={0,1,2,3,4,...}.\]</span></p>
<p>Now that all of the truffles are gone, you return to your village and
brag about how delicious the truffles were. Chef Preston asks if your
group of truffle searchers could provide her with 10 truffles for her
new chocolate truffle recipe. You agree, but since you have 0 truffles,
you now somehow have less than 0 truffles, or you could say you have -10
truffles. Leading us to the set of <strong>integers</strong> which
includes the natural numbers, their opposites, and zero. <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb{Z}={...,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,...}\]</span></p>
<p>You and your friend find 11 truffles, 10 for Chef Preston and 1
extra. What is there to do with this extra truffle except eat it? If you
have 1 truffle and 2 people to eat it then neither person receives an
entire truffle, but all we have at this point are numbers in the set of
integers, <span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{Z}.\)</span> This
does not allow for the case where we have 1 item split into 2 pieces,
perhaps some sort of ratio, <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}.\)</span> These types of numbers are
the <strong>rational</strong> numbers <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb{Q} = {...,-4, -\frac{7}{2} -3,
-\frac{2}{3}, 0, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{10}{5}, \frac{127}{3}, ...}\]</span>
These numbers are any numbers that can be represented as a ratio and
therefore include the integers. As decimals, these numbers can all be
represented as terminating or repeating decimals.</p>
<p>After eating half a truffle and walking back to town you discover a
perfectly circular truffle. You measure the circumference and diameter
and divide these two numbers, and while this number is close to $, you
notice this does not give you a rational number, it is an
<strong>irrational</strong> number. The result is a non-repeating,
non-terminating decimal. This set of numbers is notated as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}-\mathbb{Q}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \\ \mathbb{Q}.\)</span> Which means the
set of <strong>real</strong> numbers less the set of rational numbers.
So what are the real numbers?</p>
<p>You can think of the set of real numbers <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> as all numbers that can be
represented as a ratio or that cannot be represented as a ratio. That is
the union of the sets of rational and irrational numbers. These are the
numbers we are usually working with in algebra. However, donâ€™t despair
our journey through the set of numbers is not over yet.</p>
