## Factoring Higher Degree Polynomials

In keeping with our theme of abstraction, we can examine the structure of an expression to represent or interpret it a different manner. For instance, $$x^{4}-y^{4}$$ is similar to previous cases.

There are also some special cases for factoring cubic polynomials. Let's look at

- $(a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2})$
- $(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})$

Other cases will mostly be left for future classes.
