# Factoring Polynomials

## Factoring Quadratics

Remember that the approach we took for multiplying two binomials together,

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
(2x+3)(3x+4) &= 2x(3x+4) + 3(3x+4)\\
&= 6x^{2} + 8x + 9x + 12\\
&= 6x^{2} + 17x + 12\\
\end{array}
$$

If we approach this process in reverse, it is one method of factoring a quadratic expression. The general form of a quadratic expression is $ax^{2}+bx+c$ and we will often use $a$ to refer to the coefficient of the quadratic term, $b$ for the coefficient of the linear term, and $c$ for the constant. If we multiply $ac$ and then look for the factors of this product that sum to $b$. For the previous example we would begin with $6 \cdot 12 = 72$ and this list the factors of $72.$

$$
\begin{array}{c}
1 \cdot 72 \\
2 \cdot 36 \\
3 \cdot 24 \\
4 \cdot 18 \\
6 \cdot 12 \\
8 \cdot 9 \\
\end{array}
$$

The factors that sum $b=17$ are 8 and 9. So we can the separate the linear term into these two addends, $6x^{2} +8x+9x+12.$ We then factor by grouping, $$2x(3x+4)+3(3x+4)=(3x+4)(2x+3)$$

Notice that after the first factoring by grouping, both binomials in the parentheses are identical.

### Special Cases

Consider

- $(a+b)^{2}$
- $(a-b)^{2}$
- $(a+b)(a-b)$
