# Polynomials

A **polynomial** is an expression that consists of variables and constants and the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation with **non-negative** integer powers. That is, they can be written as $$a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \dots + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0}.$$

A polynomial consists of many **monomials**. And if we have polynomial consisting of two monomials it is called a **binomial** and with three monomials, a **trinomial**.

We can talk about the **degree** of a polynomial which is the highest power in the polynomial.

## Operations

### Scalar Multiplication

Given a polynomial $ax$ and a scalar $k$, then $k \cdot ax = kax$.

### Polynomial Addition

Polynomials can be added by combining like terms. This means we will add together any terms in which the variables have the same degree.

We can think of polynomial subtraction either as its own operation or we can treat it as addition with a scalar multiple.

$ax - bx = ax + -1(bx)$

### Polynomial Multiplication (Distribution)

We can multiply monomials by multiplying the constants and variables, that is $ax \cdot bx = (ab) \cdot (xx) = abx^{2}$. For larger polynomials we need to develop a more rigorous rule set. Consider $ax(bx+c)$, the product of a monomial and a binomial. Here we need to appeal to the distributive property which results in $ax\cdot bx + ax \cdot c = abx^{2} + acx$.

This is the idea we need for multiplying larger polynomials. We must make sure every term in each polynomial is multiplied together.

- (ax + b)(cx+d)
- (ax + b)(cx^{2}+dx+f)

Multiplying binomials is a common operation and raising them to higher powers can be quite tedious. We have two common methods for addressing this issue.

#### Pascal's Triangle

The most accessible of these two methods is Pascal's Triangle.

#### The Binomial Theorem

### Polynomial Division (Caveats Again)

#### Closure
