# Polynomials

A **polynomial** is an expression that consists of variables and constants and the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation with **non-negative** integer powers. That is, they can be written as $$a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \dots + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0}.$$

A polynomial consists of many **monomials**. And if we have polynomial consisting of two monomials it is called a **binomial** and with three monomials, a **trinomial**.

We can talk about the **degree** of a polynomial which is the highest power in the polynomial.
