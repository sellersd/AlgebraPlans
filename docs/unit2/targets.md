# Sets and Polynomials

## Learning Targets

3. Define the imaginary number $i$ such that $i^{2} = -1$.

4. Add, subtract, and multiply polynomials, showing that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers, namely, they are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

5. Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it.

- Example: See $x^{4} - y^{4}$ as $(x^{2})^{2} - (y^{2})^{2}$, thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as $(x^{2} - y^{2})(x^{2} + y^{2})$
