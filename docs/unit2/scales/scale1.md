| 4     | Exceeds the standard.                                                                                                                               |
| 3     | Student can simplify radicals requiring the use of the imaginary unit.                                                                              |
| 2     | Student can complete prerequisite skills with little to no mistakes. For example, student can simplify roots that do not require imaginary numbers. |
| 1     | Student can do little to no work without prompting..                                                                                                |

**Standard:** Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it.
