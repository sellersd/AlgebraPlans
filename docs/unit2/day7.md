# GCF

Consider $9x^2+3x$. This polynomial consists of 2 monomials, lets examine it in pieces to build a conceptual model.

| Constants | Prime Factorization |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| $9$       | $3^{2}$             |
| $3$       | $3^{1}$             |

| Variables | Prime Factorization |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| $x^{2}$   | $x^{2}$             |
| $x$       | $x^{1}$             |

Based on our previous experience, we know the GCF of the constants is $3^{1}$ and analogously for $x$, $x^{1}.$

Find the GCF for $60x^{12}+15x^{9} +9x^{6} + 3x^{3}.$
