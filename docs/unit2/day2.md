# Complex Numbers

Solve $\sqrt{4}.$

Solve $x^{2} = 4.$

There is a subtle difference in these two cases. $\sqrt{4}=2$, but $x^{2}=4$ has two cases. Even though we use the square root method to solve this equation and it has similarities with the first cases, $\sqrt{x^{2}}=\sqrt{4}$, the better way to ask the question is what number squared equals 4, and in this case it is both 2 and -2, so we end up with $x=\pm 2.$

Similar to our discussion about truffles as we delve into the world or abstraction, the previous sets of numbers do not handle every need. Consider the equation $x^{2} = -4$. Using the square root method, we have $x=\pm \sqrt{-4}$. If $x \in \mathbb{R}$ then there is no solution, or more precisely, the is no real solution. But what if there was some other set of numbers that would provide a solution to these sets of problems. This seems somewhat strange and unfamiliar to us because it is introduce so late in the mathematical journey, but it is no different than when fractions or negative numbers were introduced previously.

This new set of numbers is the **complex** numbers, $\mathbb{C}$, and they allow us to take the square root of negative numbers. The complex numbers are a **superset** of the real numbers. This means all real numbers are complex numbers.

## The Imaginary Unit

The complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part and take the form $z=a+bi$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $i=\sqrt{-1}.$ For now, the key piece of information is that taking the square of a negative number is now possible.

### Examples

These simplify just like in previous units, but we now use the imaginary unit and complex numbers in the simplification process.

1. $\sqrt{-4}=\sqrt{-1 \cdot 4} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{4}=2i$
1. $\sqrt{-9}$
1. $\sqrt{-16}$
1. $\sqrt{-25}$
1. $\sqrt{-36}$
1. $\sqrt{-49}$
1. $\sqrt{-64}$
1. $\sqrt{-81}$
1. $\sqrt{-100}$
1. $\sqrt{-121}$
1. $\sqrt{-144}$

1. $\sqrt{-50}$
1. $\sqrt{-162}$
1. $\sqrt{-72}$
1. $\sqrt{-32}$
1. $\sqrt{-128}$
1. $\sqrt{-99}$

Not all roots of negatives require complex numbers.

1. $\sqrt[3]{-8}$

## Application

So we now know that for $x^{2}=-4$, $x=\pm 2i.$
