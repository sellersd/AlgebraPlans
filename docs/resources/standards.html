<li>Compute the conditional probability of event A given event B, using
two-way tables or tree diagrams.</li>

<li>Recognize and describe the concepts of conditional probability and
independence in everyday situations and explain them using everyday
language.</li>

<ul>
<li>Example: Contrast the chance of having lung cancer if you are a
smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.</li>

<li><ol start="41" type="1">
<li>Explain why the conditional probability of A given B is the fraction
of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in
context.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: the probability of drawing a king from a deck of cards,
given that it is a face card, is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\frac{4}{52}}{\frac{12}{52}}\)</span>, which
is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>.</li>
