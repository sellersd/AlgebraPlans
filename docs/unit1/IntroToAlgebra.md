# Introduction to Algebra

## Learning Targets

4. Interpret **linear, quadratic,** and exponential expressions in terms of a context by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity.
5. Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of
   the quantity represented by the expression.

- a. Factor quadratic expressions with leading coefficients of one, and use the factored form
  to reveal the zeros of the function it defines.
- b. Use the vertex form of a quadratic expression to reveal the maximum or minimum value
  and the axis of symmetry of the function it defines; complete the square to find the vertex
  form of quadratics with a leading coefficient of one.
- c. Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions.

- Example: Identify percent rate of change in functions such as $y = (1.02)^{t}$, $y = (0.97)^{t}$, $y = (1.01)^{12t}$, $y = (1.2)^{t/10}$, and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.

## Day 1 - Abstraction and Properties

The key idea we want to take from algebra is that we can represent many ideas in the same manner.

Take for instance the following situations.

- For each student taking the exam, each one must be provided two pencils. Find an equation that represents the number of pencils needed.
- Each item bought cost \$2. Find an equation that represents the total cost.
- Every day, two students are chosen to give morning announcement. Find and equation that shows how many students are chosen after some number of days.

What is true about the equations?

This idea holds for many situations and other operations. Consider:

- If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?
- If a bacteria undergoes binary fission every 24 hours, and you start with a single bacteria, how many bacteria are there after 64 days?

Our goal for this course is that you can see similarities between situations and use a basic set of properties to handle infinitely many scenarios.

### Basic Ideas

#### Definition of Division

Let $m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}$ Then we say $n | m$ if there exist a $p$ such that $np=m.$

This leads to the important caveat that we cannot divide by zero.

#### Vocabulary

- Identity
- Inverse
- Associative Property
- Commutative Property
- Distributive Property
- Properties of Equality

#### Properties can depend on operation

- Additive Identity $a + e = a$
- Additive Inverse $a + a^{-1} = e$
- Multiplicative Identity $a \cdot e = a$
- Multiplicative Inverse $a \cdot a^{-1} = e$

#### Properties of Equality

Assume $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$

- Reflexive Property
  - $a = a$
- Symmetric Property
  - If $a=b$ then $b=a.$
- Transitive Property
  - If $a = b$ and $b=c$ then $a=c.$
- Additive Property
  - If $a=b$ then $a+c=b+c.$
- Multiplicative Property
  - If $a=b$ then $ac=bc.$

### Properties of fractions

Examine in both directions.
$$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}$$
$$ \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$$

## Day 2 - Application of Properties

Use the properties discussed to solve the following equations.

1. $x+3=9$
2. $2x=6$
3. $2x+3=9$
4. $4x + 9 = 7x -21$
5. $3(x-8) +12 = 11-2(x+1)
6. $2(3-(x+2)) = (x+5)\cdot 7$

#### Solve as is and clear fractions first.

7. $x+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{3}$
8. $\frac{3}{4}x = \frac{5}{7}$
9. $\frac{1}{8}x-\frac{2}{5}=\frac{3}{10}$
10. $\frac{4}{7}(\frac{1}{3}x-\frac{5}{9}) = \frac{3}{5}(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{7}{4}x)$

### Literal equations

Again, we can use these same rules in a myriad of situations.

1. Solve for $t$ in $d=rt.$
2. Solve for $w$ in $P=2l+2w.$
3. Solve for $c$ in $e=mc^{2}.$
4. Solve for $c$ in $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$
5. Solve for $C$ in $F=\frac{9}{5}C + 32.$

## Day 3 - Exponent Rules

Exponentiation is repeated multiplication. Complete the following tables.

## Day 4 - Rational Exponents

Consider $x \cdot x$. Using rules we know then we know this is $x^2.$ From this we gather that $\sqrt{x^{2}} should be $x.$ While this is true, in more complicated cases it can be notationally confusing. For instance, $\sqrt[3]{x^{24}}.$

From here we can introduce a new notation to simplify these cases. The 3 is the index, 24 is the power and $x^{24} is the radicand. We can rewrite this expression as $x^{\frac{24}{3}}$ and this is called a rational exponent. We can now see that this simplifies easily to $x^{8}$ meaning that the cube root of $x^{24}$ is $x^{8}$ since $x^{8} \cdot x^{8} \cdot x^{8} = x^{24}.$
