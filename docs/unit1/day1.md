# Introduction to Algebra

## Day 1 - Abstraction and Properties

The key idea we want to take from algebra is that we can represent many ideas in the same manner.

Take for instance the following situations.

- For each student taking the exam, each one must be provided two pencils. Find an equation that represents the number of pencils needed.
- Each item bought cost \$2. Find an equation that represents the total cost.
- Every day, two students are chosen to give morning announcement. Find and equation that shows how many students are chosen after some number of days.

What is true about the equations?

This idea holds for many situations and other operations. Consider:

- If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?
- If a bacteria undergoes binary fission every 24 hours, and you start with a single bacteria, how many bacteria are there after 64 days?

Our goal for this course is that you can see similarities between situations and use a basic set of properties to handle infinitely many scenarios.

### Basic Ideas

#### Definition of Division

Let $m,n,p \in \mathbb{Z}$ Then we say $n | m$ if there exist a $p$ such that $np=m.$

This leads to the important caveat that we cannot divide by zero.

#### Vocabulary

- Identity
- Inverse
- Associative Property
- Commutative Property
- Distributive Property
- Properties of Equality

#### Properties can depend on operation

- Additive Identity $a + e = a$
- Additive Inverse $a + a^{-1} = e$
- Multiplicative Identity $a \cdot e = a$
- Multiplicative Inverse $a \cdot a^{-1} = e$

#### Properties of Equality

Assume $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$

- Reflexive Property
  - $a = a$
- Symmetric Property
  - If $a=b$ then $b=a.$
- Transitive Property
  - If $a = b$ and $b=c$ then $a=c.$
- Additive Property
  - If $a=b$ then $a+c=b+c.$
- Multiplicative Property
  - If $a=b$ then $ac=bc.$

### Properties of fractions

Examine in both directions.
$$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}$$
$$ \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$$
