11. Given a relation defined by an equation in two variables, identify the graph of the relation as the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane. Note: The graph of a relation often forms a curve (which could be a line).

12. Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of the equations $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ intersect are the solutions of the equation $f(x) = g(x)$.
    a. Find the approximate solutions of an equation graphically, using tables of values, or finding successive approximations, using technology where appropriate. Note: Include cases where $f(x)$ is a linear, quadratic, exponential, or absolute value function and $g(x)$ is constant or linear.

13. Select an appropriate method to solve a quadratic equation in one variable.
    a. Use the method of completing the square to transform any quadratic equation in x into an equation of the form $(x â€“ p)^{2} = q$ that has the same solutions. Explain how the quadratic formula is derived from this form.
    b. Solve quadratic equations by inspection (such as $x^{2} = 49$), taking square roots, completing the square, the quadratic formula, and factoring, as appropriate to the initial form of the equation, and recognize that some solutions may not be real.

14. Define a function as a mapping from one set (called the domain) to another set (called the range) that assigns to each element of the domain exactly one element of the range.
    a. Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context. Note: If f is a function and x is an element of its domain, then f(x) denotes the output of f corresponding to the input x.
    b. Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to the quantitative relationship it describes. Limit to linear, quadratic, exponential, and absolute value functions.

15. Compare and contrast relations and functions represented by equations, graphs, or tables that show related values; determine whether a relation is a function. Explain that a function f is a special kind of relation defined by the equation y = f(x).

16. Identify the effect on the graph of replacing $f(x)$ by $f(x)+k$, $k \cdot f(x)$, $f(k \cdot x)$, and $f(x +k)$ for specific values of $k$ (both positive and negative); find the value of $k$ given the graphs. Experiment with cases and explain the effects on the graph, using technology as appropriate. Limit to linear, quadratic, exponential, absolute value, and linear piecewise functions.

17. Use graphs and tables to show that a quantity increasing exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly or quadratically.

18. For a function that models a relationship between two quantities, interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities, and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description of the relationship. Note: Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; maximums and minimums; symmetries; and end behavior. Extend from relationships that can be represented by linear functions to quadratic, exponential, absolute value, and linear piecewise functions.

19. Define sequences as functions, including recursive definitions, whose domain is a subset of the integers.
    a. Write explicit and recursive formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences and connect them to linear and exponential functions.

    - Example: A sequence with constant growth will be a linear function, while a sequence with proportional growth will be an exponential function.

20. Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression.
    a. Factor quadratic expressions with leading coefficients of one, and use the factored form to reveal the zeros of the function it defines.
    b. Use the vertex form of a quadratic expression to reveal the maximum or minimum value and the axis of symmetry of the function it defines; complete the square to find the vertex form of quadratics with a leading coefficient of one.
    c. Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for exponential functions.

    - Example: Identify percent rate of change in functions such as $y = (1.02)^{t}$, $y = (0.97)^{t}$, $y = (1.01)^{12t}$, $y = (1.2)^{t/10}$, and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.

21. Combine different types of standard functions to write, evaluate, and interpret functions in context. Limit to linear, quadratic, exponential, and absolute value functions.
    a. Use arithmetic operations to combine different types of standard functions to write and evaluate functions.

    - Example: Given two functions, one representing flow rate of water and the other representing evaporation of that water, combine the two functions to determine the amount of water in a container at a given time.

    b. Use function composition to combine different types of standard functions to write and evaluate functions.

    - Example: Given the following relationships, determine what the expression S(T(t)) represents.

    | Function | Input                    | Output                      |
    | -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |

    | S        | Grade in course: g       | Amount of screen time: S(g) |
    | T        | Amount of screen time: t | Number of followers: T(t)   |
