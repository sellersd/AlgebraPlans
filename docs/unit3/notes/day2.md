# Types of Equations

We will focus on a subset of equations that are technically functions but for now will only consider them as equations.

## Constants

### y=c

### x=c

## Linear

### Slope

$m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$

### Slope Intercept From

$y=mx+b$

### Point Slope Form

$y_{2}-y_{1}=m(x_{2}-x_{1})$

### Standard Form

$Ax+By=C$

## Quadratic

## Cubic
