# Roots and Zeros

A **root** or **zero** of an equation or function is the point in which the graph of the function crosses the x-axis. This is the number that if plugged into the equation the result will be zero. We will discuss this for equations now and elaborate on functions more in a later unit.

## The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that for a polynomials of degree $n$ there exists $n$ Complex roots some of which may be repeated.

## Algebraic Approach

Consider the expression $x^{2}+4x+4$ as we saw in the previous unit we can factor this expression into $(x+2)^{2}.$ We can extend this idea to equations, $y=x^{2}+4x+4=(x+2)^{2}.$ This allows us to embed more information in this quadratic expression. We will begin by exploring its roots. We know from The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that we must have two roots, and we know that roots occur on the x-axis, and that the y-coordinate of any point on the x-axis is zero. So, we should be able to find the roots by letting $y=0.$ So,

$$
\begin{array}{c}
y &= x^{2}+4x+4\\
x^{2}+4x+4 &=0\\
(x+2)^{2} &=0\\
x+2  &= \pm 0\\
x  &= -2 \pm 0\\
x  &= -2
\end{array}
$$

The steps with $\pm 0$ are not normally shown, but are included here to show that while the only solution we have is $x=-2$, this is a repeated root. We have $x=2+0$ and $x=2-0$ which reduce to the same solution. The same thing happens if you use the Quadratic Formula.

- Solve $x^{2}+4x+4=0$ using the Quadratic Formula.

### Multiplicity of Roots

### Multiple Methods

For each of the follow solve using factoring, square root method (demo needed), and the Quadratic Formula.

- $y=25x^{2}+16$
- $y=64x^{2}-121$

For these functions, solve by GCF and the Quadratic Formula.

- $y=4x^{2}-9x$
- $y=3x^{2}+12x$
