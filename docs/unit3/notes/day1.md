# Roots and Zeros
A **root** or **zero** of an equation or function is the point in which the graph of the function crosses the x-axis. This is the number that if plugged into the equation the result will be zero. We will discuss this for equations now and elaborate on functions more in a later unit.

## The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that for a polynomials of degree $n$ there exists $n$ Complex roots some of which may be repeated.

## Algebraic Approach
## Graphical Approach

## Multiplicity of Roots

### Examples

$y= 4x -2$
