23. Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and those that can be modeled with exponential functions.
    a. Show that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals, while exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.
    b. Define linear functions to represent situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.
    c. Define exponential functions to represent situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another.
