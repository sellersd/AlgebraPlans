25. Use the mathematical modeling cycle to solve real-world problems involving linear, quadratic, exponential, absolute value, and linear piecewise functions.

26. Represent constraints by equations and/or inequalities, and solve systems of equations and/or inequalities, interpreting solutions as viable or nonviable options in a modeling context. Limit to contexts arising from linear, quadratic, exponential, absolute value, and linear piecewise functions.

27. Interpret linear, quadratic, and exponential expressions in terms of a context by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity.

    - Example: Interpret the accrued amount of investment $P(1 + r)^{t}$ , where $P$ is the principal and $r$ is the interest rate, as the product of $P$ and a factor depending on time $t$.

28. Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and those that can be modeled with exponential functions.
    a. Show that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals, while exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.
    b. Define linear functions to represent situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.
    c. Define exponential functions to represent situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another.
