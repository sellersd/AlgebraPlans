32. Use mathematical and statistical reasoning with bivariate categorical data in order to draw conclusions and assess risk.

    - Example: In a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of flu shots A and B, 21 subjects in treatment group A avoided getting the flu while 29 contracted it. In group B, 12 avoided the flu while 13 contracted it. Discuss which flu shot appears to be more effective in reducing the chances of contracting the flu.
    - Possible answer: Even though more people in group A avoided the flu than in group B, the proportion of people avoiding the flu in group B is greater than the proportion in group A, which suggests that treatment B may be more effective in lowering the risk of getting the flu.

    |            | Contracted Flu | Did Not Contract Flu |
    | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
    | Flu Shot A | 29             | 21                   |
    | Flu Shot B | 13             | 12                   |
    | Total      | 42             | 33                   |

33. Design and carry out an investigation to determine whether there appears to be an association between two categorical variables, and write a persuasive argument based on the results of the investigation.

    - Example: Investigate whether there appears to be an association between successfully completing a task in a given length of time and listening to music while attempting the task. Randomly assign some students to listen to music while attempting to complete the task and others to complete the task without listening to music. Discuss whether students should listen to music while studying, based on that analysis.

34. Distinguish between quantitative and categorical data and between the techniques that may be used for analyzing data of these two types.

    - Example: The color of cars is categorical and so is summarized by frequency and proportion for each color category, while the mileage on each car’s odometer is quantitative and can be summarized by the mean.

35. Analyze the possible association between two categorical variables.
    a. Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way frequency tables and represent using segmented bar graphs.
    b. Interpret relative frequencies in the context of categorical data (including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).
    c. Identify possible associations and trends in categorical data.

36. Generate a two-way categorical table in order to find and evaluate solutions to real-world problems.
    a. Aggregate data from several groups to find an overall association between two categorical variables.
    b. Recognize and explore situations where the association between two categorical variables is reversed when a third variable is considered (Simpson's Paradox).

    - Example: In a certain city, Hospital 1 has a higher fatality rate than Hospital 2. But when considering mildly-injured patients and severely-injured patients as separate groups, Hospital 1 has a lower fatality rate among both groups than Hospital 2, since Hospital 1 is a Level 1 Trauma Center. Thus, Hospital 1 receives most of the severely injured patients who are less likely to survive overall but have a better chance of surviving in Hospital 1 than they would in Hospital 2.

37. Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions, intersections, or complements of other events ("or," "and," "not").

38. Explain whether two events, A and B, are independent, using two-way tables or tree diagrams. Conditional probabilities – that is, those probabilities that are “conditioned” by some known information – can be computed from data organized in contingency tables. Conditions or assumptions may affect the computation of a probability.

39. Compute the conditional probability of event A given event B, using two-way tables or tree diagrams.

40. Recognize and describe the concepts of conditional probability and independence in everyday situations and explain them using everyday language.

    - Example: Contrast the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.

41. Explain why the conditional probability of A given B is the fraction of B's outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in context.

- Example: the probability of drawing a king from a deck of cards, given that it is a face card, is $\frac{\frac{4}{52}}{\frac{12}{52}}$, which is $\frac{1}{3}$.
