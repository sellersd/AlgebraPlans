<li><p>Use mathematical and statistical reasoning with bivariate
categorical data in order to draw conclusions and assess risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: In a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of flu
shots A and B, 21 subjects in treatment group A avoided getting the flu
while 29 contracted it. In group B, 12 avoided the flu while 13
contracted it. Discuss which flu shot appears to be more effective in
reducing the chances of contracting the flu.</li>
<li>Possible answer: Even though more people in group A avoided the flu
than in group B, the proportion of people avoiding the flu in group B is
greater than the proportion in group A, which suggests that treatment B
may be more effective in lowering the risk of getting the flu.</li>
</ul>

<tr class="odd">

<li><p>Design and carry out an investigation to determine whether there
appears to be an association between two categorical variables, and
write a persuasive argument based on the results of the
investigation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Investigate whether there appears to be an association
between successfully completing a task in a given length of time and
listening to music while attempting the task. Randomly assign some
students to listen to music while attempting to complete the task and
others to complete the task without listening to music. Discuss whether
students should listen to music while studying, based on that
analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Distinguish between quantitative and categorical data and between
the techniques that may be used for analyzing data of these two
types.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: The color of cars is categorical and so is summarized by
frequency and proportion for each color category, while the mileage on
each car’s odometer is quantitative and can be summarized by the
mean.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Analyze the possible association between two categorical
variables.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way frequency
tables and represent using segmented bar graphs.</li>
<li>Interpret relative frequencies in the context of categorical data
(including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).</li>
<li>Identify possible associations and trends in categorical data.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Generate a two-way categorical table in order to find and
evaluate solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Aggregate data from several groups to find an overall association
between two categorical variables.</li>
<li>Recognize and explore situations where the association between two
categorical variables is reversed when a third variable is considered
(Simpson’s Paradox).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: In a certain city, Hospital 1 has a higher fatality rate
than Hospital 2. But when considering mildly-injured patients and
severely-injured patients as separate groups, Hospital 1 has a lower
fatality rate among both groups than Hospital 2, since Hospital 1 is a
Level 1 Trauma Center. Thus, Hospital 1 receives most of the severely
injured patients who are less likely to survive overall but have a
better chance of surviving in Hospital 1 than they would in Hospital
2.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of
outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as
unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,”
“not”).</p></li>
<li><p>Explain whether two events, A and B, are independent, using
two-way tables or tree diagrams. Conditional probabilities – that is,
those probabilities that are “conditioned” by some known information –
can be computed from data organized in contingency tables. Conditions or
assumptions may affect the computation of a probability.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the conditional probability of event A given event B,
using two-way tables or tree diagrams.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognize and describe the concepts of conditional probability
and independence in everyday situations and explain them using everyday
language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example: Contrast the chance of having lung cancer if you are a
smoker with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Explain why the conditional probability of A given B is the
fraction of B’s outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer
in context.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Example: the probability of drawing a king from a deck of cards,
given that it is a face card, is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{\frac{4}{52}}{\frac{12}{52}}\)</span>, which
is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>.</li>
