18. Solve systems consisting of linear and/or quadratic equations in two variables graphically, using technology where appropriate.

19. Select an appropriate method to solve a system of two linear equations in two variables.
    a. Solve a system of two equations in two variables by using linear combinations; contrast situations in which use of linear combinations is more efficient with those in which substitution is more efficient.
    b. Contrast solutions to a system of two linear equations in two variables produced by algebraic methods with graphical and tabular methods.
