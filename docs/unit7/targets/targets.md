21. Compare properties of two functions, each represented in a different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal descriptions). Extend from linear to quadratic, exponential, absolute value, and general piecewise.

22. Interpret the parameters of functions in terms of a context. Extend from linear functions, written in the form $mx + b$, to exponential functions, written in the form $ab^{x}$.

    - Example: If the function $V(t) = 19885(0.75)^{t}$ describes the value of a car after it has been owned for $t$ years, 19885 represents the purchase price of the car when $t = 0$, and 0.75 represents the annual rate at which its value decreases.

23. Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

24. Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.
    a. Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima.
    b. Graph piecewise-defined functions, including step functions and absolute value functions.
    c. Graph exponential functions, showing intercepts and end behavior.

25. Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function (presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph. Limit to linear, quadratic, exponential, and absolute value functions.
