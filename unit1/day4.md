## Day 4 - Rational Exponents

Consider $x \cdot x$. Using rules we know then we know this is $x^2.$ From this we gather that $\sqrt{x^{2}} should be $x.$ While this is true, in more complicated cases it can be notationally confusing. For instance, $\sqrt[3]{x^{24}}.$

From here we can introduce a new notation to simplify these cases. The 3 is the index, 24 is the power and $x^{24} is the radicand. We can rewrite this expression as $x^{\frac{24}{3}}$ and this is called a rational exponent. We can now see that this simplifies easily to $x^{8}$ meaning that the cube root of $x^{24}$ is $x^{8}$ since $x^{8} \cdot x^{8} \cdot x^{8} = x^{24}.$
