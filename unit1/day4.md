## Day 4 - Rational Exponents

Consider $x \cdot x$. Using rules we know then we know this is $x^2.$ From this we gather that $\sqrt{x^{2}} should be $x.$ While this is true, in more complicated cases it can be notationally confusing. For instance, $\sqrt[3]{x^{24}}.$

From here we can introduce a new notation to simplify these cases. The 3 is the index, 24 is the power and $x^{24} is the radicand. We can rewrite this expression as $x^{\frac{24}{3}}$ and this is called a rational exponent. We can now see that this simplifies easily to $x^{8}$ meaning that the cube root of $x^{24}$ is $x^{8}$ since $x^{8} \cdot x^{8} \cdot x^{8} = x^{24}.$

### Applications

1. $\sqrt{p^{8}}$
1. $\sqrt[4]{n^{32}}$
1. $\sqrt[5]{\frac{p^{40}}{q^{15}}}$
1. $\sqrt[9]{x^{99}y^{18}}$
1. $\sqrt[3]{\frac{x^{-6}y^{12}z^{18}}{x^{9}y^{4}z^{21}}}$
1. $\sqrt[4]{16x^{8}}$
1. $\sqrt[3]{x^{13}}$

### Simplifying radicals

These same ideas can be used to simplify radicals with constant radicands. For instance $\sqrt{8}$ is $\sqrt{4 \cdot 2}$ and by our properties $\sqrt{4}\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}.$

The process we are using here is looking for factors of the radicand that are perfect roots, factor the radicand and take the root.

### Applications

1. $\sqrt{50}$
1. $\sqrt{128}$
1. $\sqrt{250}$
1. $\sqrt{108}$
1. $\sqrt[3]{256}$
1. $\sqrt[3]{250}$
1. $\sqrt[3]{16}$
